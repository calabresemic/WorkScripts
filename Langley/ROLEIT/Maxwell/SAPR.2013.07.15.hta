	<p><font color="white" size=5><b>(July 15)</b> Service Before Self: An Airman's professional duties always take precedence over his personal desires. It is her professional responsibility to acknowledge and act immediately when she observes misconduct - even if the personal cost might be high. Not "liking" conflict is not an excuse. A good leader places her people ahead of her personal comfort and does not indulge in self-pity, discouragement, anger, frustration or defeatism.</font></p>
